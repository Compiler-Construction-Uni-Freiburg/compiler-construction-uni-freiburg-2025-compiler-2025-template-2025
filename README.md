# Exercises

This is your exercise repository for all exercises of the compiler
construction course.

For each exercise, we will create an `exercise-N` directory with a
similar structure as in `exercise-01` containing the exercise task as
a `README.md` and starter files to get you going.

After the deadline of an exercise has been exceeded, we will also add
the solutions repository for that exercise in `exercise-N/solution`.

To merge the solutions and new exercise tasks into this repository,
make sure to synchronize with our template repository after a new
exercise has been announced. This can be done by hitting the `Sync`
button on the Github page of your repository.
Do not create `exercise-N` and solution directories by yourself,
unless you enjoy resolving merge conflicts ;)

If you have questions about the specific exercise tasks or the
exercise infrastructure, feel free to ask in the
[Chat](https://chat.laurel.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/invite/WRjCqL)!

## Required Software

- The starter code provided for the exercises requires at least **Python 3.12**.

- To run the test code you need to have **Docker** installed.

- The scripts and testing infrastructure assume a unix-based operating system, e.g. **Linux/MacOS**.

- Note: We use **mypy** for type checking and **ruff** for linting and formatting, but **pylance/pyright** works as well.
