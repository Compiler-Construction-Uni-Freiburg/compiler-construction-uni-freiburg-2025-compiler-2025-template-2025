# Exercise 10

Your task is to answer some questions about the topics discussed in this course.

For each question you will be given a function stub in `src/questions.py`.
The doc-string and typing of each function will specify what the corresponding question is and what return value corresponds to which answer.

Implement the functions such that the right answer is returned.
